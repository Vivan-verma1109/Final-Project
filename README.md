# ID-tech-Rough_Draft
This file is (so far) a rock paper scissors game.
Basically an image is added to the file and that image is ran through a keras model
The model identifies the imag and then plays the game against a bot and that's it. 
Simple yet effecient.
I think it's great for when you are bored and unable to interract with anyone.
Better something than nothing
