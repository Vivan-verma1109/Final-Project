This file is (so far) a rock paper scissors game. Basically an image is added to the file and that image is ran through a keras model The model identifies
the imag and then plays the game against a bot and that's it. 
Simple yet effecient. 
I think it's great for when you are bored and unable to interract with anyone.

The update is that I have added a simple guessign game. The model takes in a photo from the user and then generates a random number in the computer. It then checks against the computer if 
it is correct or not. Then it prints out the true answer and whether or not you won.
